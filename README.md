# Vending Machine FSM (Verilog)

This repository contains a simple Verilog vending machine controller and a self-checking testbench.

The design models a vending machine that:

- Accepts **Nickels (5¢)**, **Dimes (10¢)**, and **Quarters (25¢)**
- Vends an item that costs **25¢**
- Returns **change** when more than 25¢ is inserted
- **Refunds** any remaining credit as coins when `reset` is pressed

## Files

- **`vending_machine.v`**  
  Main RTL module implementing the vending machine as a finite state machine (FSM).

- **`vend_sim.v`**  
  Self-checking testbench that instantiates `vending_machine` and drives it with stimulus from a vector file.

- **`test_vector.tv`** (expected, not generated by Verilog)  
  Text file with binary test vectors used by `vend_sim.v`.
